Hi there! I'm Andrew, a Melbourne-based developer who is passionate about building reliable, easy to use, well-tested software.

In addition to Software Development, I have a strong background in IT infrastructure & Linux, and thoroughly enjoy utilising my knowledge of these different areas to rapidly design, build and deploy reliable, well-tested systems to solve unique business problems.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my amazing girlfriend & our 3 cats, reading about (and playing with) technology, and watching TV.
